## Graph Modeling Applications

###

#### 1.3.1:
The minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of this associated graph should be 3. This cannot be fewer, i.e. 2, because there is a triangle, e.g. BCF, which needs at least to color its vertices so that each vertex has a unique color.

#### 1.3.2:
The wrongs of the given computer program is:
- The vertex following the start point need another resource that we cannot determine when it will process. It will stuck here since this vertex cannot be processed.

#### 1.3.3:
Since the buyer firstly bought O's, the probability that the next three purchases are W's, O's and then W's is:
`0.4*0.3*0.4 = 0.048`

#### 1.3.4:
