# Chapter 1:  INTRODUCTION TO GRAPH MODELS

## Section 1.2: COMMON FAMILIES OF GRAPHS

#### 1.2.1: 
``K_n: n*(n-1)/2 = C_2^n``
``K_{m,n}: m*n``

#### 1.2.2:
What is the maximum possible number of edges in a simple bipartite graph on `m` vertices:
- Maximum number of edges in ``K_{a,b}`` is `a*b`, since `a+b=n`, maximum of `a*b` should be `n^2/4` when ``n`` is even (`a=b=n/2`) or `(n^2-1)/4` when `n` is odd (`a=(n-1)/2, b=(n+1)/2`)

#### 1.2.3: 
The smallest non-bipartite graph should contain no vertices or edges

#### 1.2.4:
The graph cannot be bipartite if it contains a triangle. Otherwise, it is.
-  `K_n:  n \leq 2`
-  `C_n: n % 2 == 0`, or `n` is a multiple of 2.
-  `P_n: `always, since it contains only two vertices.
